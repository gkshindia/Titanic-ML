While feature engineering is a discipline in itself, too broad to be covered here
 in detail, you will have a look at a simple example by creating your own new
 predictive attribute: family_size.

A valid assumption is that larger families need more time to get together on 
a sinking ship, and hence have lower probability of surviving. Family size is 
determined by the variables SibSp and Parch, which indicate the number of family 
members a certain passenger is traveling with. So when doing feature engineering,
 you add a new variable family_size, which is the sum of SibSp and Parch plus one 
 (the observation itself), to the test and train set.'''
